# Element remover(Chrome extension)

Have you tired of pop-up windows? Just remove them! Hold down the shortcut and press the left mouse button.

You can customize any shortcut by pinning this extension to the browser's panel. It's not recommended to use ctrl, as when working quickly and frequently using ctrl-x, ctrl-c, ctrl-v, you can accidentally delete something else.
